This repository contains sample code used in my recent Master's Dissertation "Low-Resource Accent TTS Support via Large Multi-Accent Neural Frontend Pronunciation Knowledge Transfer."

The code was used to quantify the "accent similarity" of 14 accents (with each other accent) modelled simultaneously in a BiLSTM-based Seq2Seq frontend (text to linguistic specification) model, using Levenshtein distance. 

The results, depicted as a heat map, are also included for reference.
