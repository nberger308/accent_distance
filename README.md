This repository contains sample code used in my recent Master's Dissertation "Low-Resource Accent TTS Support via Large Multi-Accent Neural Frontend Pronunciation Knowledge Transfer."
The code Levenshtein.py was used to quantify the "accent similarity" of 14 accents (with each other accent) modelled simultaneously in a BiLSTM-based Seq2Seq frontend (text to linguistic specification) model, using Levenshtein distance. 
The results are included in a heatmap.
